# Clustering Project
 Unsupervised Machine Learning using KMeans clustering and PCA

This project was our first unsupervised machine learning project at NOD Coding Bootcamp. 

It was done using [credit card customer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/credit-card-customer-data) by Arya Shah on Kaggle.

After KMeans clustering and pairplotting out the components from the PCA this is what the result looked like:

Furthermore, this is what the individual variables looked like for the different clusters.

Once we plot the PC1 and PC2 against eachother we get the following result:

When we add the third component, unfortunately, it does not give us much more information, but the graph looked cool so here it is:
